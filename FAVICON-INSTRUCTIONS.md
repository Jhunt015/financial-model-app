# How to Add Your Favicon

I can see your favicon image! To add it to the project:

## Steps:

1. **Save the favicon image** you provided as `favicon.png` in the `/public/` folder
2. **Replace the existing placeholder** at `/Users/jasonhunt/financial-model-app/public/favicon.png`

## Current Setup:

The HTML file is already configured to use `/favicon.png`:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png" />
```

## Manual Steps:

1. Right-click on your favicon image
2. Save it as `favicon.png` 
3. Place it in the `/public/` folder of your project
4. Replace the existing placeholder file

The favicon should then appear in your browser tab automatically when you refresh the page.

## For the Logo:

You can also save the same image as `logo.png` in the `/public/` folder if you want to use it as your main logo in the header, or provide a separate logo image.

The app is already configured to look for both files and will fall back to the "E" placeholder if the files aren't found.
